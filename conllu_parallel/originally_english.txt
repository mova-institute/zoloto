n01063051

n01063011 Miami Bass producers were clinical in the art of moving butts—their main concern.
n01063011

n01063043 In a recent interview, Zay and Zayion described recording their version of “Knuck If You Buck” on a home laptop.
n01063043

n01063048 But challenges, and the songs that score them, add a connective, traceable nervous system to the writhing mass of grainy video loops.
n01063048

n01064096 Like many people I know, I’ve spent recent months staying up late, reading polls in terror.
n01064096

n01064113 Caplan dismisses retrospective voting, quoting a pair of scholars who call it “no more rational than killing the pharaoh when the Nile does not flood.”
n01064113

n01064009 It would be much safer, Plato thought, to entrust power to carefully educated guardians.
n01064009

n01065073 But there was nothing else obviously artistic about her or in her behavior with other people.
n01065073

n01066093 “Complete neglect of his own health,” his wife, Alice, reported.
n01066093

n01066045 In 2010, the foundation released a typeset edition of “Zettel’s Traum,” removing the bar to entry for those who balked at the draft-like feel of the photo-offset.

n01066068 Corresponding with Woods by e-mail, I tried my hand at uncovering an etym.
n01066068

n01067023 Also being exhibited for the first time are British Ministry of Defence maps which imagine cold war battles and which were used in military college exams.
n01067023

n01067014 Each map in the exhibition tells its own story, not all factual.
n01067014

n01068029 The constituency is in the council area of North Kesteven, where 62% of voters backed leaving the EU.
n01068029

n01068038 His skill in getting answers for taxpayers will be sorely missed.
n01068038

n01069014

n01069006 The Liberal Democrats, who represented the affluent suburb until 2010, are hoping to snatch it back with their candidate Sarah Olney.
n01069006

n01069004 Christian Wolmar, who has written a number of books on railway history, will stand in the contest on 1 December.
n01069004

n01069023 He was utterly gracious and took it like a man, I am beyond furious.
n01069023

n01070020 People got killed there.

n01070016 More than 330 crew are onboard the ship.

n01072021 One of their many grieving Facebook posts has a line which would have delighted Chris: “More African than you, I have not known.”
n01072021

n01072010 He then spent four years with BBC World Service radio at Bush House.
n01072010

n01072012 He worked for the BBC for a decade.
n01072012

n01073004 Who can stop this Australia side?
n01073004

n01073023 Was their divine right to the mantle as the world’s best no longer warranted?
n01073023

n01074030 You have to stand up to that and I would rather someone ran at me rather than round me.
n01074030

n01074020 He has got that hard edge to his game but also the soft hands.
n01074020

n01074015 South Africa are almost at the point of no return and we have to be able to match their desire.
n01074015

n01074026 We have a great squad and it is an opportunity for us to take the ship forward.
n01074026

n01074011 They have one crack at redemption, beating England.
n01074011

n01075044 Australia, hardened by their recent games in the Rugby Championship, were in a higher gear.
n01075044

n01075028 It was as though he was flicking the ball back and forth underneath three upturned cups.
n01075028

n01076030 He’s spoken in favour of torture.
n01076030

n01076017 Mrs Clinton has a reputation for a hawkish outlook, but this will be tempered by war-weary public opinion in the US.
n01076017

n01076006 A Donald Trump victory would immediately make the world more worrying and unsettled than it already is.
n01076006

n01077018 I also struggle with passwords.
n01077018

n01077030 Then there are the so-called true stories that get posted in a series of meaningful pictures with text running underneath.
n01077030

n01078025 Of course, I do understand that modern-day Germany must be separated from the Nazi regime.
n01078025

n01079015 In the corner is a girl in a headscarf and jeans who looks so unassuming I think it’s another assistant.
n01079015

n01079069 His more unusual accolades include global ambassador for New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and a place at Harvard Business School.
n01079069

n01079065 Artists reach people at their heart; it’s the only time we meet in one place and put our differences aside.
n01079065

n01080042 I wanted to watch it with them, but they decided they’d rather watch it without me in the end.
n01080042

n01080039 I can just do that with my life.
n01080039

n01081022 We can’t let the presidency go to Donald Trump, someone so racist, sexist and incredibly unqualified to be commander-in-chief.
n01081022

n01082014 “More people are turning to credit … While this borrowing might be manageable now, a sudden change in circumstances could lead to debt problems.”
n01082014

n01083035 In this context, railing against trade makes sense.
n01083035

n01083013 Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.
n01083013

n01084023 Meanwhile, Bank of Scotland customers earn 3% on balances of £3,000-£5,000 when they add the free Vantage option to their account.
n01084023

n01084008 Theoretically, a couple could open four Tesco accounts and earn 3% on £12,000 – £360.
n01084008

n01084045 That 3% rate also applies to Nectar cardholders looking to borrow from £15,001-£19,999 over a period of between two and three years.
n01084045

n01084036 With this, in theory, you are able to access your money whenever you like.
n01084036

n01085011 Surprising as it may seem, even acid rain clouds can have a silver lining.
n01085011

n01085008 Fast forward to 2016 and this is increasingly worthy of attention.
n01085008

n01085006 Sulphur is a key plant nutrient vital to healthy growth, but UK soils are naturally deficient in this essential mineral.
n01085006

n01086013 The world may be enraging and absurd – yet at least someone has the self-respect to keep protesting against that fact.
n01086013

n01086016 You end up listening more acutely for the next noise and getting more irritated when it comes.
n01086016

n01086031 That’s just legitimately horrendous.
n01086031

n01087035 “I loved the tropical colours,” he says.
n01087035 „Мені сподобались тропічні кольори“, каже він.

n01087039 “I visit the degree shows at Northampton University to spot new talent,” he says.
n01087039

n01087023 Catalano moved back to the area after living in London and then Glasgow, where he had studied jewellery design at Glasgow School of Art.
n01087023

n01087018 I think that’s why they immersed themselves in pattern and colour.
n01087018

n01087005 It’s fair to say that Rocco Catalano works, lives and breathes retro.
n01087005

n01088026 But, when I suggest that she get Frank to model for her, she laughs.
n01088026

n01089033 Wintour herself appears briefly, and is filmed putting her sunglasses on before being interviewed.
n01089033

n01089007 Naturally, the office landscape features many clothes and little in the way of food.
n01089007

n01090037 I love to play with that and I am always looking for muses that fit that bill because it is so interesting making a collection when I find one.
n01090037

n01090004 I looked at motocross and the more I looked, this one woman’s face kept coming up, in photographs that looked as if they were from the 1970s.
n01090004

n01091019 The RSPB’s stance has also brought it into conflict with many leading conservationists, from the author of the petition, Mark Avery, to the TV presenter Chris Packham.
n01091019

n01091013 At best it is naive and at worst it would yet again let the shooting lobby off the hook.
n01091013

n01091017 Their head of nature policy, Jeff Knott, stated: “I’d be amazed if either a ban or licensing was introduced off the back of it”.
n01091017

n01092040 “We are actively thinking of possible ways to limit the scope of litigation to only those with a real standing in a project,” he was quoted as saying.
n01092040

n01092014 And what about Australia’s position?
n01092014

n01092008 Let’s just say he’s wrong.
n01092008

n01092025 On this, one diary point in Morocco will be the middle Saturday, when developed countries get to publicly question each other about their plans and ambitions.
n01092025

n01093024 But big reductions have also been pencilled in for cod, sole, plaice, megrim and pollack in the Celtic and Irish Seas.
n01093024

n01093007 “Celtic Sea cod could collapse,” without the proposed limits, one EU official said.
n01093007

n01093025 Conservationists welcomed the commission’s announcement.
n01093025

n01094014 Only 50 were marketplaces.
n01094014

n01094022 “Agora was invitation-only but many of these marketplaces are easily accessible if you know how to search,” Dr Lee adds.
n01094022

n01095019 Day three, I was back on the EMicro.
n01095019

n01095004 They didn’t have them in our day, and people without children express through their disapproval all their hatred of modern parenting.
n01095004

n01095009 I don’t call it a beast lightly.
n01095009

n01096032 Companies may try to set up a firewall between sensitive systems and foreign powers, but it does not always work.
n01096032

n01096006 The world – and by extension the UK – is facing a shortage of people with the skills needed to mount an effective defence.
n01096006

n01096040 But they can at least lay booby-traps to confuse and deter – a concept known as “active defence”.
n01096040

n01097041 I spotted a few.
n01097041

n01097098 My next stop was Bellingham, right up near the Canadian border.
n01097098

n01097020 After I discovered a rich seam of internet discussion on the subject, my list had grown inordinately long and covered almost every state in the union.
n01097020

n01098044 At each station, a red-capped guard presides over the platform and a wheel-tapper walks along the train with a hammer, gently knocking the undercarriage.
n01098044

n01098041 A small town with two minarets glides by.
n01098041

n01098034 Back on the train, we continue southwards.
n01098034

n01099035 Afterwards, browse at the morning market (6.30-10am): rice lollipops, wasp cocoons (the pupae are considered a delicacy), buffalo lung, betel-nut bark and leaves, live toads and catfish.
n01099035

n01101007 The oath involves lawmakers swearing allegiance to Hong Kong as part of the People’s Republic of China.
n01101007

n01101017 Hong Kong, meanwhile, appears to be bracing for a wave of protests.
n01101017

n01101012 The Hong Kong government, which is led by pro-Beijing lawmakers, have argued that the pair should not take office.
n01101012

n01101003 The intervention is potentially the most far-reaching by Beijing since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the UK.
n01101003

n01101015 “Beijing believes its intervention is necessary to prevent a continued legislative paralysis in the city,” he said.
n01101015

n01102006 He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “A general election is frankly the last thing that the Government wants.”
n01102006

n01103013 It is his dream to end his career here.
n01103013

n01104011 To draw a game you have dominated is easy to brush off, but to do so three times is a row suggests a weakness.
n01104011

n01104019 We are so disappointed because we have dropped six points playing at home.
n01104019

n01105023 I also wonder whether the Davis Cup played a part.
n01105023

n01105013 But right now everything is out of kilter and he seems to be seeking answers all the time.
n01105013

n01105003 That was definitely the case for Andy when he played Benoît Paire in Monte Carlo in April.
n01105003

n01106015 Ms Hopley added: “The spike in political risk should not go unnoticed.”
n01106015

n01106008 The annual survey also revealed that worries about taking on fresh financial burdens has rocketed.
n01106008

n01107006 It has also opened VW up to huge compensation claims, legal action and has seen it take more than €16bn of provisions.
n01107006

n01107008 The probe began in June, focusing on Mr Winterkorn and brand chief Herbert Diess, who remains at the car maker.
n01107008

n01107005 News of the company’s deceit - which had run for years - wiped tens of billions of euros from VW's value and cost chief executive Martin Winterkorn his job.
n01107005

n01107010 He was promoted to chairman in October 2015, the month after the scandal was unearthed.
n01107010

n01108005 Retail and wholesale businesses expanded as shoppers remained upbeat, and consumer services companies also grew.
n01108005

n01108015 There will be limits to his ability to spend, however, as the Government is still running a substantial budget deficit.
n01108015

n01108003 Businesses had expected to start contracting in July, immediately after the Brexit vote, but instead have managed to keep growing steadily.
n01108003

n01109008 The cost will change monthly and the price is expected to rise in winter as usage increases.
n01109008

n01109022 Or is it an expensive standard or prepayment tariff?
n01109022

n01109012 Eon’s fixed rate tariff costs £760 and Avro Energy customers would pay around £760 for its Simple and Select tariff.
n01109012

n01110006 An investor with average luck and £10,000 in bonds could expect to receive £125 in prizes per year.
n01110006

n01110022 The money invested in Premium Bonds, and in other National Savings & Investments accounts, is used to help fund Government spending.
n01110022

n01110008 If they did, Premium Bonds would be indistinguishable from ordinary savings accounts.
n01110008

n01111021 It was followed by the Aviva Investors Multi Strategy Target Return and Income funds, into which investors put £2bn and £1.4bn respectively.
n01111021

n01111030 This means that they have not benefited from the uplift that the fall in sterling has given to overseas assets.
n01111030

n01111018 This has not stopped investors flocking to put their money in the funds.
n01111018

n01112012 The consumer can boost the demand for change.
n01112012

n01112014 A major report in January said oceans would contain more plastic than fish by 2050 unless the world took radical action to stop rubbish leaking into the seas.
n01112014

n01112002 Adidas is helping to clean up the Earth's oceans by using the waste floating around the world to make shoes.

n01113021 After some genius surgery and a lot of very tough rehab, I have made a full recovery.
n01113021

n01114012 Warning that the NHS was now under "enormous pressure," he urged the public to take more responsibility for their own health.
n01114012

n01114025 Four in 10 adults have been injured due to bad weather while nine in 10 underestimate how chilly Britain can get in the winter time.
n01114025

n01115005 They will play on Saturday, 10 June.
n01115005

n01115013 Last year was an incredible year and I’m ready for us to come back even better in 2017.
n01115013

n01116018 Where does all her energy come from? Or that voice, which can blast out with a force to induce shockwaves?
n01116018

n01116009 She started out at the RSC in the mid-Sixties playing an asylum-inmate in Marat/Sade.
n01116009

n01116021 Her neck pushes forward in vein-accentuating confrontation, her hands shake.
n01116021

n01116035 But having allowed Glenda to score such a blinder, who can blame it?
n01116035

n01116014 The dress is contemporary.
n01116014

n01117014 In theory, if done right, it’s un-detectable.
n01117014

n01117007 He worked on the news and current affairs side of radio and TV for decades.
n01117007

n01118003 Drop the mic.
n01118003

n01118017 "Cinema had changed so drastically that Hollywood had alienated the family audience."
n01118017

n01118010 According to the director's own count, to date he has made eight feature films.
n01118010

n01119011 From the director's point of view, the film is a precarious balancing act, between cheery family hijinks and hard-hitting social drama.
n01119011

n01119017 And, of course, there's Bob, a constant source of entertainment.
n01119017

n01119012 On one level, it works as an amiable, unpretentious heartwarmer that seems tailor-made for Sunday afternoon viewing.
n01119012

n01119019 The result, then, is hardly the cat's pyjamas.
n01119019

n01120010 Doss’s story also has an unlikely quality to it that makes it all the more appealing.
n01120010

n01120020 All the medics were armed, except me.
n01120020

n01120008 To modern audiences, most of whom will have little experience of frontline conflict, Doss’s feats belong to the realm of the unimaginable.
n01120008

n01121032 When Millican died, we assumed that was the last we’d see of glitchy, twitchy Odi too.
n01121032

n01121051 Is series two working so far?
n01121051

n01122024 “Superheroes are outside of human experience and so is this, so I treated it like a drama,” Zimmer says.
n01122024

n01123010 But Cotton’s dark deeds did not occur due to some sort of compulsion to kill.
n01123010

n01123024 Perhaps it won’t matter as I won’t be troubled long.
n01123024

n01123012 Cotton was born on October 31, 1832, in a village near Sunderland.
n01123012

n01125009 No longer a throwback to the Seventies, flock – or coating a surface is material – is flying again.
n01125009

n01125030 Of course, the tactile trend is closely linked to our growing obsession with making things.
n01125030

n01125016 London’s landmark South Bank Tower commissioned interior designer Rachel Winham to design the show apartment.
n01125016

n01127089 I don't know why I chose her ...
n01127089

n01127008 Two years later, Jutting, now 31, is on trial at Hong Kong's High Court, charged with two counts of murder and one of preventing lawful burial.
n01127008

n01127130 In Hong Kong's High Court, two years later, Jutting appeared largely composed.
n01127130

n01128021 As a result, many people quickly open emails or mindlessly click on links and attachments with nary a thought of its consequences.
n01128021

n01128033 Finally, we must make it easy for people to report suspected breaches and malicious emails.
n01128033

n01128017 After all, our organizational performance is seldom measured in terms of how safe we are or how many rules we follow.
n01128017

n01128025 First, we must educate people on how to protect themselves better online.
n01128025

n01129006 Voting has, in the vernacular of terror, become the new soft target.
n01129006

n01129010 This is a homeland security issue of the most existential kind.
n01129010

n01129017 Tuesday is all about getting out the vote, but it means nothing if a registered voter isn't on the list.
n01129017

n01129021 Enough of those, in a highly contested area, will lead to chaos election day.
n01129021

n01130025 Donald Trump is a pompous, arrogant, entitled person that cares about himself, and his temperament is toxic to the United States.
n01130025

n01130003 North Carolina is ground zero in this election.
n01130003

n01133014 The Dutch students have yet to decide if they will be commercializing their electric motorcycle.
n01133014

n01133022 A Harley-Davidson spokeswoman said timelines that have been floated in the media -- 2017 or 2020 -- aren't accurate.
n01133022
